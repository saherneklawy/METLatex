newcsen.cls              - new class file to compile course documents
config.tex               - example file to test the class
PracticeAssignment01.tex - example file to test the class
GUC-logo.pdf      	 - PDF vectorized version of the GUC logo (gets loaded with option "logo" unless other file is specified)
GeorgJung-thumb.png	 - PNG file for testing purposes (can be specified as alternative logo)
FExtinguish.pdf          - Another logo to test the scaling

Implemented so far:
- Automatic result table
- Automatic search for global config file in current and parent and parent of parent directory
- options: all
- commands: \Institute{} \Department{} \Class{} \Title{} \Lecturer[]{} \Email{} \Logo{} \Topic{} \Date{} and more
- exercise environment
- bonusexercise environment
- options practice (default) and assignment usable now
- scratch paper generator
- cover pages
- spacing

To do:
- testing
- cleanup (consistently prefix variable names and booleans, tighten code)
- better collecting mechanism for formulas for the formula sheet (capable of specifying displaymath)
